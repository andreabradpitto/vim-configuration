# Welcome to my Vim configuration's readme file

This repository hosts my Vim configuration file (`vimrc`) that takes care of installing all my plugins and changes some stettings when first launched on a new machine.

## Disclaimer

Currently, `vimrc` comments are in italian. Maybe I will translate them to english in the future.

## Instructions

1 - Move `.vim` folder inside user's directory (`C:\users\<YOUR_USERNAME>` for Windows or `~/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>` for Linux)

2 - [Optional] Before launching Vim, remove any previously created `.viminfo` files. It will be created inside `.vim` by my configuration. Alternatively, you can manually import old data inside the new `viminfo` file

3 - Launch Vim. It will download all required plugins and change the default/current Vim settings

4 - Enjoy!
