This repository hosts my Vim configuration file (`vimrc`) that takes care of installing all my plugins,
and changes some stettings when first launched on a new machine.

## Instructions

1 - Move `.vim` folder inside user's directory (`C:\users\<YOUR_USERNAME>` for Windows or `/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>` (alias: `~`) for Linux-based systems)

2 - In case of Windows, rename the `.vim` folder into `vimfiles`.
> [!WARNING] <!-- Markdown alerts: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925 -->
> Notice that in this scenario you will also have to edit some paths in `vimrc`.

3 - [Optional] Delete the rest of this repository in order to clean up some space

4 - [Optional] Before launching Vim, remove any previously created `.viminfo` files (by default, it will be in your `%HOMEPATH%` [CMD]/`$HOME` [PowerShell]/`~` [Bash]).
The new `.viminfo` will be created inside the `.vim` folder by this configuration.
You may also manually import old data from the `.viminfo` file to the new one, before eventually deleting the former

5 - Launch Vim. On first execution, it will download all required plugins and change the default/current Vim settings

6 - Enjoy!

### A note on `vimrc`, `.viminfo`, & other autogenerated files

As reported by the Vim help (`:help vimrc`):

```plain text
        Places for your personal initializations:
                Unix            $HOME/.vimrc or $HOME/.vim/vimrc
                MS-Windows      $HOME/_vimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc
                                or $VIM/_vimrc
                Amiga           s:.vimrc, home:.vimrc, home:vimfiles:vimrc
                                or $VIM/.vimrc
                Haiku           $HOME/config/settings/vim/vimrc

        The files are searched in the order specified above and only the first
        one that is found is read.

        RECOMMENDATION: Put all your Vim configuration stuff in the
        $HOME/.vim/ directory ($HOME/vimfiles/ for MS-Windows). That makes it
        easy to copy it to another system.
```

Thus, I am simply following Vim's recommendation about `vimrc` file.
Additionally, I decided to put in the same folder also `.viminfo`.
Another Vim-autogenerated file, `.netrwhist` (see this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/seanh/3c32f6d4f1e27669c4d8a1d3ce3c215b)), is already located inside `.vim` by default, so I did not have to tweak anything in that case.
