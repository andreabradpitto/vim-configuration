# Welcome to my Vim configuration's readme file

## Disclaimer

Currently, `vimrc` comments are in italian. Maybe I will translate them into english in the future.

## Instructions

1 - Create `.vim` folder inside user's directory (`C:\users\<YOUR_USERNAME>` for Windows or `~/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>` for Linux)

2 - Paste `vimrc` inside the newly created directory

3 - [Optional] Before launching Vim, remove any previously created `viminfo` files. It will be created inside `.vim` by my configuration. Alternatively, you can manually import old data inside the new `viminfo` file
